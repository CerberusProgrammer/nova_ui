## 📺 What is NoVa UI? 🎮

NoVa (from **No**stalgic **Va**nguard) is a comprehensive Flutter design system that embraces the charm of yesterday's visions of tomorrow. Remember those sleek, glowing interfaces from movies like TRON, classic sci-fi, or even Mr. Incredible's computer screens? That's the aesthetic we're bringing to your Flutter apps!

> "The future as imagined in the past, coded for today's applications." 🔮

## 💫 Inspiration & Style 💫

Our design system draws inspiration from:

- 🎬 Retro sci-fi movie interfaces (TRON, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey)
- 🖥️ 80s and 90s computer aesthetics
- 🎮 Classic arcade and early video game UI
- 🦸 Superhero tech interfaces (like those in Mr. Incredible)
- 📟 Vintage digital displays and control panels

We combine these elements with modern usability principles to create something both nostalgically familiar and excitingly functional!
